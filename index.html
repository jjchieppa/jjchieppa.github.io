            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I am a research scientist with a deep passion for plant ecology, climate science, and the integration of data science with biological systems. Over the course of my career, I have worked across multiple scales of biological organization, from photosynthetic biochemistry and organ-level function to plant-insect interactions, community dynamics, and continental-scale insect forecasting.</p>

            <p>My research journey began in 2011 as an intern studying wildlife movement ecology in New York City, but I quickly found myself drawn to plant-environment interactions. Since then, I have conducted field and laboratory studies in southern pine forests, the Australian Outback, Florida mangroves, Midwestern prairies, and countless greenhouses and growth chambers, always seeking to understand how plants function under changing environmental conditions. My work has covered leaf-level photosynthetic physiology, whole-plant responses to stress, fungal and insect interactions, and broad-scale phenology and disease forecasting in grapes.</p>

            <p>In 2022, I transitioned out of academia and joined a machine learning and crop forecasting team, applying data science, statistical modeling, and artificial neural networks to improve disease management in agriculture. This role expanded my expertise beyond plant science to include predictive analytics for agricultural pests, leading me to develop models for insect movement and survival under future climate scenarios. Along the way, I deepened my skills in R and Python, enabling me to work across empirical analysis, mechanistic modeling, and computational forecasting.</p>

            <p>Now, I am eager to return to ecology and environmental research, bringing my multiscale perspective and computational expertise to address pressing challenges in plant ecology, climate adaptation, and conservation. My work bridges physiology, population dynamics, and large-scale forecasting, leveraging diverse datasets to explore how organisms respond to environmental change.</p>
