    <div class="bio-text" style="flex: 1; text-align: justify; font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.5;">
        <p>Grasslands are important ecosystems worldwide, and their diversity and productivity is strongly linked to rainfall patterns and soil nutrient availability. 
            Changes in water and soil nutrients, associated with climate change and management regimes, are likely to have strong consequences for grasslands in the future. 
            While the relationship between rainfall, nutrients, and grassland productivity has been well described, 
            a mechanistic explanation as to why some grassland communities are more sensitive than others remains elusive. <p>
            </p>Plant functional traits are useful to address this issue on a global scale, as they represent life history strategies and are universal across all plant taxa. 
            Such traits often represent the inevitable trade-off between rapidly acquiring resources and the increasing rate of tissue turnover. 
        Such faster-growing species, referred to as acquisitive species, can be compared with conservative species, which are slower growing and have low rates of tissue turnover, along the resource-use axis. 
        To address how grasslands may respond to future changes in rainfall and fertilisation, 
        I conducted a series of experiments using grasses and grassland ecosystems to study how traits may be used to understand variation in sensitivity across species and communities. 
        <p>My research illustrates that the abundance of acquisitive and conservative plant species in a community can result in high levels of variation in productivity, 
            a primary function of grasslands critical for pasture utilisation and carbon sequestration. 
         I found that root traits of grasses were responsive to phosphorus fertilisation. 
            As the primary organ for water uptake in plants, changes in root morphology associated with P availability may alter how grassland communities respond to changes in precipitation.
        </p>
         <p> In addition, I found grouping species based on their functional types was helpful in quantifying plant biomass in remote arid and semi-arid regions, 
             where logistics of scientific investigation can be difficult. 
             More specifically, I developed a set of allometric equations which use non-destructive proxies (plant cover and height) to estimate plant biomass. 
             These estimates were improved by grouping species based on the functional type (i.e. rough morphological and life-history characteristics).</p> 
             
             <p>Finally, I investigated how interspecific plant interactions (namely competition) may change under different timing and severity of 
                 droughts to identify key candidate grasses for multispecies pasture utilisation. 
                 Ultimately, this work contributes valuable information regarding the underlying mechanisms to varying sensitivity in productivity in grassland communities and individual grass species, 
                 which will be increasingly important to manage under future climatic scenarios.</p>

            <p>I did my MSc in the Forest Health Dynamics Laboratory at Auburn University's School of Forestry and Wildlife Sciences. 
            There, I worked on Southern Pine Decline (SPD), a disease complex affecting the productivity of southern pine species, including loblolly pine. 
            Stressed pine trees (due to edaphic, climatic, or genetic predispositions) release volatile compounds that attract root-feeding beetles, which in turn vector pathogenic fungi. 
            Mature trees exhibiting SPD symptoms show crown dieback, reduced productivity, and a loss of fine root biomass.</p>

            <p>For my thesis, I worked with loblolly pine seedlings, inoculating them with fungi associated with SPD. 
            Genotypes with varying resistance and tolerance to SPD fungi were grown in open-top chambers (OTCs) at the Atmospheric Deposition Research Facility. 
            We exposed them to elevated tropospheric ozone (first experiment) or fluctuating moisture supply (drought, second experiment) 
            and assessed the interactive effects of climatic stressors and SPD fungi, exploring potential genetic relationships for cross-tolerance.</p>

            <p>While working for the Forest Health Dynamics Laboratory, I also contributed to projects monitoring bark beetle populations 
            (field capture, laboratory identification, responses to forest management), studying the effects of invasive grass on mycorrhizal colonization of pine, 
            conducting forest health surveys (crown rating, allometry), and working in the wood products research space.</p>

        <!-- Urban Heat Island Study -->

            <p>While working on my MSc, I took on a side project to explore urban heat islands (UHIs) in small cities. 
            Using a machine learning-based classification approach, we applied the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) system to satellite imagery, identifying urban and rural zones in Auburn and Opelika, Alabama. 
            By deploying temperature sensors in multiple LCZs, we assessed how urban development influenced local temperatures. 
            Results confirmed urban areas were consistently warmer, but UHI intensity varied even in similar zones, 
            suggesting that LCZ-based classifications alone may not fully predict heat retention. 
            This study demonstrated the potential of ML-driven remote sensing for urban climate analysis while highlighting its limitations in smaller, heterogeneous landscapes.</p>
